## Description 

Combining the skills I learned with Express and MySQL, this application adds another npm package called Sequelize. This ORM package helps convert the data values when retrieving and posting data to the database. Through expanding upon the given code-base, I implemented different routes and added various models in order to make the application function correctly. With e-commerce reigning as the largest sector in the electronics industry, having a functional backend is critical to maintaining a successful business. After creating the database and starting the server (see Installation below), the user can then access the database using the Postman application and change, update, and delete data.
